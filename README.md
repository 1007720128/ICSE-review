# ICSE Conference Code Review

This project contains the implementation of various algorithms and models for the ICSE conference code review.

## Project Structure

### Runner

The `runner` file serves as the entry point for running the project. It provides the main execution flow and orchestrates the different components.

### Algorithms

The `algos` folder contains the implementation of the algorithms. This includes:

- Spatio-temporal network
- Collaborative autoscaling approach

### Load Balancing

The `load_balancing.py` file implements the load balancing algorithm, which optimizes traffic distribution within the system.
